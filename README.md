# Overview

This framework provides a simple demonstration using TCP over a local network. 

{Provide a description the networking program that you wrote. Describe how to use your software.  If you did Client/Server, then you will need to describe how to start both.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (you will need to show two pieces of software running and communicating with each other) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Network Communication

This program uses a client / server model.

Connection made using TCP, port number selected at random when server instance is run. Port number printed in server console. 

Text messages encoded in “ascii”

File transfer
